# Corona Dojo Katas

The inestimable [David Whitney](https://twitter.com/david_whitney) is running some [code dojos](https://www.meetup.com/Coronadojo) while everyone in the UK is on lockdown. Good guy. Post session I'm going through the kata and putting together a solution. Dave's selection of katas are all over on [his github](https://github.com/davidwhitney/CodeDojos). 

Everything (so far) is in python3, has been built using TDD with pytest and is (or should be) Pep8 compliant.

Absolutely none, and it's weird that you would even think about it.
